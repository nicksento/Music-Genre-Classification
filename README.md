# Music Genre Classification

In this project we use a dataset of audio files to build an RNN-LSTM network for Music Genre Classification.

The dataset that we are going to use is the GTZAN Dataset which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification).
